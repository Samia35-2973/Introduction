        <h4>Hello there! Myself, Samia Haque Tisha</h4>
        <p>I am student of Software Engineering at Daffodil International University. I live in Dhaka with my<br>
        mother and younger brother. My father lives in sylhet because of his job. My result in HSC was 4.42 <br>
        out of 5.00 and in SSC it was 5.00 out of 5.00. My father is a teacher and my mother is a housewife. <br>
        My brother reads in class VI. I usually do problem solving at my leisure. Coding is my passion. So, I <br>
        always try to improve my coding skills. I also practiced some of web designing skills. My hobbies are <br>
        playing PUBG, painting and watching movies. I usually do sketches based on something and paintings of <br>
        my fantasy world. However, I barely get time to improve my art skills. I play PUBG with my friends at night. <br>
        It's fun that we can talk and play at the same time. I always try to watch a movie or series everyday <br>
        because it refreshes my mind. Mostly, I watch anime. I also like playing outdoor games such as Badminton <br>
        and Basketball. However, I am a newbie in Basketball. I try to challenge myself in newer things to gain more<br> 
        knowledge and to be the better version of myself.</p>
        <h4>That's all about me. Thank you. Have a good day.</h4>
